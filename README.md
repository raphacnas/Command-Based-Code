# 🤖 Command-Based Robot Code

"Command-Based" is a way of, in the FIRST context, talk about a ```Object Oriented Programming``` way of setting up the robot code, which is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

## ❓ Where can I find the code?

Unlike the teleoperated's, the command-based code is all over the src/main/java/frc/robot due to the way it is meant to work like.
